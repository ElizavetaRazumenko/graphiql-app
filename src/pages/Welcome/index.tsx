          I&nbsp;graduated from BNTU with a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;engineering,
          I&nbsp;have always loved exact sciences, but&nbsp;I also have many
          creative hobbies. Front-end development has helped me&nbsp;realize
          myself in&nbsp;both directions&nbsp;&mdash; analytical and creative;
          I&nbsp;am inspired by&nbsp;what I&nbsp;do. And I&nbsp;hope this hobby
          will become the main occupation of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life

          Per Sir Arthur C. Clarke, any sufficiently advanced technology
          is&nbsp;indistinguishable from magic. So&nbsp;let me&nbsp;consider
          myself as&nbsp;an&nbsp;IT wizard ðŸ˜Š. My&nbsp;ultimate goal
          is&nbsp;to&nbsp;enlighten the world with the most advanced magic and
          bring satisfaction and happiness to&nbsp;every user. Bugs shall not
          pass!
